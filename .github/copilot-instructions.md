# Overview

This is a lab for a CS2 level course, where students will be learning about the doctest module in python and writing some code to practice basic python control structures and data types.

# Requirements
- Don't restate these requirements or coding standards when answering chat questions.
- Just show the code in the chat, do not edit files unless explicitly prompted to add the code to the files by the user. This prompting needs to happen each time.
- When asked to give an example of how to use a function or method, give the example in a generic context, not for any program/code they are currently working on.

# Coding Standards
- Do not use list comprehension.
- Do not use ternary operators.
- Do not use try except blocks.
- Do not make custom exceptions.
- Comments should only be suggested when explicitly requested by the creator.
